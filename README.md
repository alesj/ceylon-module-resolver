Building
--------

For setting up the development environment and compiling and building the distribution
take a look at [ceylon-dist](https://github.com/ceylon/ceylon-dist#ceylon-distribution).

If after having built the distribution you want to build and test the module resolver
return to `ceylon-module-resolver` and run

    ant clean publish
    
To run the tests type

    ant test
    
Alternatively you can build this project using Maven:

    mvn install

But the maven build is known to not work on every system, prefer `ant clean publish`
to build the project.
